## PBR Night Sky Unity Asset

The PBR Night Sky asset is an asset that I developed to enhance the appearance of the default Unity skybox by calculating the physically accurate positions of celestial bodies such as the Sun, Moon, planets and stars. The asset allows the user to give a geographical latitude and longitude alongside a given date and time and the realtime accurate positions of the celestials will be shown in the sky. This also allows time to be stepped forward for an accurate day night cycle or the current date and time can be used for a full 24 hour cycle.
